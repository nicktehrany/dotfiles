# Dotfiles

## Installation

If zsh isn't installed, it'll ask for sudo password and install zsh.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nicktehrany/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./bootstrap
```
## In progress:

  * Missing local/private git config files
  * Ask if zsh is wanted before installing
  * zsh package check not properly working
  * installing vim if not there
  * Imporving existing .file check and ask if symlink should overwrite it
